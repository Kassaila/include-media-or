### Introduction

[**include-media**](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media) simplifies the usage of media queries in Sass. However, media features could only be connected with an AND conjunction.

This plugin enables the usage of nested lists of expressions that are connected with logical AND/OR conjunctions.
